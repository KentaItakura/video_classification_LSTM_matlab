OVERVIEW

This is a simple example of video classification using LSTM with MATLAB.
Please run the code named VideoClassificationExample.
This example was created based on a Mathworks official documentation located at 
https://jp.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/examples/classify-videos-using-deep-learning.html
While the official example requires down-loading a dataset about 2 GB, this example can try that 
with a small amout of data, which may help you giving a try easily.
Note that this is just an example of LSTM with images and please refer to the official example for your further study.
